# Tennis-Tournament-Draw-Generator
Firstly, input the number of players! (Ex. 4).
Secondly, input the names and ranks of the players (if the number of players is 4 then 4 names and 4 ranks are necessary!).
The program will randomly pair players (the top tier players won't face each other) and create a draw.
In addition, this program simulates the tournament and lets the players play with a randomized results (The results vary with the higher ranking player having a high chance of winning, but it is possible for a lower ranking player to beat a higher ranked player).
Finaly, in the end the program outputs the winner of the tournament (His rank increases if he beats a better player so the winner's rank might increase depending on his draw)
